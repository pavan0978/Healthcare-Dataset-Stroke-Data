🚀 Machine Learning Stroke Prediction Project 🧠

An advanced machine learning project designed to predict stroke occurrences using healthcare data, implementing various classification models and data preprocessing techniques.

📌 Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict stroke risk using healthcare data. It employs four classifiers — Naïve Bayes, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). To address class imbalance in the dataset, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) was applied, ensuring balanced model training and evaluation. Performance metrics including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC were used to assess model effectiveness.

🏆 Key Achievements
- Implemented four advanced machine learning classifiers (Naïve Bayes, XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM).
- Enhanced prediction accuracy through data preprocessing and class balancing with SMOTE.
- Achieved balanced model evaluation using Stratified 5-Fold Cross-Validation.
- Developed and optimized the complete model pipeline using Python and Scikit-learn.
